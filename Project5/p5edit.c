   Program Description: This program is designed apply the use of opertaing on
   strings, dynamic memory allocation, file operations, command line arguments
   and calculating and storing statistics. This is all used to create a program
   that performs various string arguments on text files such as searching for
   text, replacing words, checking spelling and formating lines.
